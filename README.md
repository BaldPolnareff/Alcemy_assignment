# Assignment

I created this repository and used Jupyter Notebooks to complete the assignment, as they would render properly on GitHub. 

I simply run my code in `Assignment.ipynb`  and then I created another notebook `Assignment_results.ipynb` to display the results in pure markdown. 

I did not create a LaTeX document (which is normally my preferred choice for long and structured documents), for time reasons. 

The `utils.py` file is just a file with some helper functions that I used in the assignment, so that the notebook containing the python code would not be too cluttered.
